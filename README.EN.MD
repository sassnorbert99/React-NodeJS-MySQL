Parameters:

Creating a LinkedIn webpage with using Nde.js for the backend and React for the frontend.
The web4 folder contains my exam for the Web programming 4 course.
In this webpage, you can create some posts and you can use this web page as facebook as well. What's more, you can make a work opportunity, which contains about the headers, names, images and everyone can put their like in your post as well.

In this application, users can make a registration and after that they can upload several posts, or just search a lot of job seekers and even you can join this group. You can edit your post, or delete them, but on the other hand, you can just read or search other user's posts and like them. 

## Roles:
- user: After registrating, they are entered into the databease, after that they can see all of the web page's service

## Header:
After the user registrates and/or just logs in, it can see every web page's function, where it can make it own post. It has the opportunity to add some employees into the employee list.

## Registration
Registration defines two things, a username and a simple password. After registrating, clients can make their own posts, like some other's posts.

## Post:
Making the post consists of 4 elements:
- You can add a title, a description, you can chhose a picture of a working place or the company, but it is just choosable
- After posting, when you click the home button, you can read all of the website's posts, what is available for everyone.


## Job seeker:
When you click the employees button, whic is in the header, you can make a job seeker. This person consists of 5 elements:
- name: Client's full name
- age: Client's age
- country: Client's country of birth
- position: holding the position for a given employee
- wage: wage per month
